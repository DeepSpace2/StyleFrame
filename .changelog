0.2dev-1:  - Added ability to change font
           - Added ability to change cell border type
           - Added 'style_obj' arg to all "styling methods" to accept Styler object so styles can be reused.
             The ability to directly pass style specifiers is deprecated and may break in a future version.
           - Added basic ability to read stylized excel into a stylized StyleFrame
             Currently doesn't support reading style from a subset of sheet (ie using startrow, startcol and the such.)
             Pass read_style=True to StyleFrame.read_excel

           INTERNAL CHANGES:
