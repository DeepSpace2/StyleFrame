### Thanks for contributing!

# Branch
Create the pull request against the `devel` branch instead of the `master`.

# Quality
All pull requests are welcome regardless of quality. We will work together to review and improve the pull request.

Of course there are some steps that could be considered to improve the quality of the pull request and to support the process of review and development.

- Make sure your code follows [PEP 8 â€” Style Guide for Python Code](https://pep8.org/). You can use some [linting tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) to automate the process (e.g. [`pycodestyle`](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org) or [`flake8`](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8)).
- Test your code using the existing test cases. For details read further.
- It would be great if you could create [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)'s for your code.

# Unittesting

This project uses Python's default [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) package. You can run all test cases via the *discover* feature when you run this in the projects root folder.

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover
```

The output should look like this
```sh
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 74 tests in 0.823s

OK
```

If you want to run a specific test case or method you need to *install* the package first. It is recommended to use a virtual environment and the  `--editable` flag of `pip`. Run this in the projects root folder:
```sh
python3 -m pip install --editable .
```
Please read further to understand the consequences of `--editable`.

### Happy coding!
